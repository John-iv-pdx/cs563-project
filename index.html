            I currently work at Intel as a Site PE, and assist with software
            development. My primary work is focused in data analysis such as
            yield, hardware recession rates, and product quality. I've always
            been interested in technology and computers as far as my memory can
            recall. It started with video games, and became an obsession by the
            time I was 10.
          </div>
          <div class="bio-end">
            I've acquired many skills along my journey, including automotive
            mechanics, welding, construction, and fabrication. There's a lot to
            do and experience in this world of ours.

          I developed this program as a teaching aid; it was much easier to
          teach kids concepts of programming principles when they had something
          that could show the changes visually. I was often teaching children
          ages 10-17, and so the features in this program are tailored to
          teaching concepts.

          I developed this program as a part of the Machine Learning course I
          took at Portland State University. This application is a build-on of
          the simple perceptron. The data this program ingests is called the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database"
            >MNIST data set</a
          >. It is a data set of 28x28 handwritten digits. The objective of this
          program is to train the MLP to accurately identify the number being
          written when provided it as an input.
